However, each video has a prominent link to the associated open thread that appears on our blog. In the past we've tried opening up the channel to comments, but we found that a very high number of episodes wound up being flooded with a combination of spam, long winded apologists, and various obscene or misogynistic comments directed at various hosts by people with an axe to grind. This seems to be the nature of YouTube comment sections, in our experience.\n\nWe do moderate the blog, the same way that we moderate chat during the show, as well as comments on our Facebook group. For comment sections that are \"officially\" associated with our show (and, to a much lesser extent, channels that may give the unintended appearance of being official), we prefer not to play host to straight up ad hominem attacks and bigotry. As a general policy we do not\u00a0block commenters simply on the basis of disagreement with our point of view. However, we do prefer discussion environments that don't actively chase off more reasonable contributors.\n\n-------\n\nThe most up to date Atheist Experience videos can be found by visiting http://atheist-experience.com/archive/\n\nYou can read more about this show on the Atheist Experience blog:\n\u25ba http://freethoughtblogs.com/axp/\n\nWHAT IS THE ATHEIST EXPERIENCE?\n\nThe Atheist Experience is a weekly cable access television show in Austin, Texas geared at a non-atheist audience.
